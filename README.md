# Machine Learning 1 - Lab Repository

Welcome to the Machine Learning 1 lab repository! Each week, new folders containing the corresponding lab files will be uploaded. Please follow the setup instructions below to ensure a smooth experience with the lab exercises.

## 🛠 Environment Setup

We highly recommend creating a **dedicated virtual environment** to work on this lab. This will help avoid conflicts with other packages on your system and make it easier to manage dependencies as the course progresses.

### Instructions:

1. Create a virtual environment using tools like `conda`.
2. Create a new conda enviroment with the following comand `conda env create --file=environment.yml`.
3. **Note:** New dependencies may be introduced in future labs, so check the requirements before each session.

## 📂 Repository Structure

Each week, a new folder with the corresponding lab files will be added. Make sure to pull the latest changes regularly to stay up to date with the lab materials.

## ❓ Need Help?

If you encounter any issues or bugs during implementation, feel free to contact the lab's TA for assistance.
